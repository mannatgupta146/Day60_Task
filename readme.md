# Day 60 Task | Cohort 2.0

This repository contains all the JavaScript exercises completed as part of **Day 58** in **Sheryians Coding School Cohort 2.0**.  
The focus was to understand OOPS concepts such as **Objects, Classes, Constructors, Prototypes, `this` keyword, call/apply/bind**, and writing cleaner reusable code.

Two JavaScript files were created:

- **script1.js** → Core OOPS concepts  
- **script2.js** → Reinforcement & additional practice  


## 📌 About Day 58 Task

Day 58 helped build a strong foundation in JavaScript OOPS.  
You learned how to organize data + behavior together, avoid repetitive code, and write scalable programs.

# 📁 Files in This Task

## 📌 script1.js — Core JavaScript OOPS Concepts

### Topics Covered
- Creating objects with properties and methods  
- Converting repeated objects into classes  
- Constructor usage and initialization  
- Understanding the `this` keyword  
- Normal function vs arrow function inside objects  
- Constructor functions (old JS method)  
- Prototypes for memory-efficient shared methods  
- Comparing function equality (prototype vs constructor methods)  
- call(), apply(), bind() to control execution context  
- Borrowing methods using call()  


## 📌 script2.js — OOPS Reinforcement & Additional Practice

### Topics Covered
- Laptop object vs Laptop class comparison  
- Employee class with independent object data  
- BankAccount class and deposit method  
- Why objects update independently  
- Fixing `this` using bind()  
- Vehicle constructor function + prototype methods  
- Prototype memory optimization  
- Practice of call(), apply(), bind() with examples  

# ✨ Key Learning Highlights

You learned to:
- Build reusable **classes** instead of repeated objects  
- Use **constructors** for initializing data  
- Share methods using **prototypes**  
- Understand how `this` works in different contexts  
- Use **call**, **apply**, **bind** to borrow or control function execution  
- Write clean, structured, OOPS-based JavaScript code  


# 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**  
- **Browser Console**  
- **HTML** to connect JS files  

# 📖 Learning Outcome

By completing Day 58, I understood:

- Core OOPS structure in JavaScript  
- Why classes prevent repetitive code  
- Why prototypes improve memory usage  
- How `this` behaves differently in various situations  
- How to use call/apply/bind effectively  
- How to write cleaner, modular JavaScript
